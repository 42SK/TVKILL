# Contributing

You want to contribute to **TV KILL**? That's great!

To make the contribution process easier for new contributors, we have compiled this set of useful guidelines to give you a basic understanding on how things should be done.

A lot of these recommendations will probably seem rather trivial to you if you are already an experienced FOSS contributor; however, to newcomers, they might not all be that self-evident.

## Issues
Regardless of whether you want to report a bug, request a feature or share other recommendations for the project, [issues](https://github.com/42SK/TVKILL/issues) are usually quite straight-forward.

Here are a few minor things to consider when opening an issue:

* **Avoid Duplicates**: Please make sure that the nobody has already opened an issue on the same topic.
* Try to give your Issue a **meaningful title** and a comprehensive description.

## Pull Requests
[Pull requests (PR)](https://github.com/42SK/TVKILL/pulls) tend to be a bit more complex than issues.

[This article](https://opensource.com/article/18/6/anatomy-perfect-pull-request) provides an excellent guide on how to write a good PR.

A few of the things to keep in mind:

* If you plan on doing something that will significantly change a large part of the code base, **consider opening an issue first**. This allows other users and developers to share their thoughts on your idea, which saves you the trouble of possibly having to change things later on.

* **One Feature per PR**: Don't overfill your PR with a bunch of unrelated miscellaneous contributions, split it up in multiple PRs, this will speed up the review process tremendously.

* Within your PR, please **[use meaningful commit messages](https://xkcd.com/1296/)**. The commit message should be a brief imperative text that clearly specifies what you have changed. You can also further elaborate your changes in the commit message body if necessary. ([This blogpost](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) has some more information on how to write good commit messages.)

* Please give your PR an **informative title** and a **thorough description** of what you have done (and why). ("Changes" might be a sufficiently informative title for a David Bowie song, but it is probably not a very good title for your pull request.)

Now that you have read these guidelines, you're pretty much all set for contributing to the **TV KILL** project!

Thanks for your time, have fun and happy hacking!
