#TV KILL - Universal IR-Remote

**TV KILL** is a mobile application for Android that enables you to turn-off TVs, using your device's built-in IR-blaster.  
The app basicly transmits a variety of off-patterns for different TVs successively, which will cause most TVs to power down.

**TV KILL** is available on Google Play and F-Droid

###Adding new patterns
If you can determine the off-pattern of a TV that is not supported yet, it would be great if you would add it to **TV KILL**.  
You can find a detailed explanation on how to add patterns to the application on [this wiki page](https://github.com/42SK/TVKILL/wiki/How-to-add-IR-patterns-to-TV-KILL).
